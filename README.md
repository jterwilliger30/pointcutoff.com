# Summary
This project was done as a favor to a friend. Apparently, the US Army uses a point system when considering enlisted soldiers for promotion to E-5/Sergeant and E-6/Staff Sergeant. In order to be eligible for promotion, you must meet a minimum point threshold specific to your MOS. These thresholds change monthly, and are published in PDF memorandums issued by the Secretary of the Army.

# Current Version
A Flask backend that web scrapes the PDFs, organizes them by month, and parses the needed data from them.

# V2.0
Flask backend, hand-written html.

# V1.0
Eel webserver, hand-written html.
